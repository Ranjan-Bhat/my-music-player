Welcome to my GitHub repository for my music player project! This project is a simple yet elegant music player that I built using HTML and CSS.

The music player features a sleek user interface that allows users to browse and play their favorite songs with ease. The player controls include play, pause, skip, and rewind buttons, along with a volume control slider. The interface also includes a search bar that enables users to find specific tracks and a playlist feature that allows users to create custom playlists.

I built this project using HTML to structure the application's content and CSS to style the user interface. I also used some basic JavaScript to implement the music player's functionality.

The music player is responsive and designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices. Whether you're listening to music on your desktop, laptop, or mobile device, this music player is sure to provide an excellent listening experience.

Feel free to download, use, and modify this project as per your requirements. I hope this project inspires you to explore the power and versatility of HTML and CSS in building beautiful and functional web applications. Thank you for visiting my repository!
